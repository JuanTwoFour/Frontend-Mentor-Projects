## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Grid

### What I learned

- Learned more about using grid and how to utilize it to my advantage when building something simple like this blog card card. Also learned not to default to a flexbox (what I was doing at the start) although flexbox is great when used correctly, for this project it felt simpler to use a display of grid instead.

### Useful resources

- [W3 schools css tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) - Probably one of the best ways to learn how to do cool things with CSS. Learned mostly more about grid.
